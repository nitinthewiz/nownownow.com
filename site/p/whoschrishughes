<h1>Chris Hughes</h1>

<h2><a href="/">/now</a>: <a href="http://whoschrishughes.com/now/">whoschrishughes.com/now</a></h2>

<h2>Location:</h2>
<p>
Ponce Inlet
FL
United States
</p>

<h2>Professional title:</h2>
<p>
The CPA Surfer since I mainly run CPA offers. Founder of Sovereign Survival. Founder Brain Smart Success.
</p>

<h2>What do you do?</h2>
<p>
My intention is to positively impact the lives of over a million people in my lifetime.
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
At this time, I'm working on building up generational wealth so when I settle down and have a family I can spend time with my wife and kids without having to worry about money. I love having an idea and being able to watch the creation of it come to life. The biggest reason I became an Entrepreneur was to have the freedom to travel the world and experience things I could only dream about growing up. Over the last 4 years I've done just that, living and visiting over 15 countries.
</p>

<h2>Recent thought or epiphany?</h2>
<p>
Whenever someone tells you that something is impossible, it's only within their life where they think its impossible. Other people's limiting beliefs don't have to be accepted by you. Anything you are crazy enough to dream up is possible.
</p>

<h2>What should we read?</h2>
<p>
Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future by Ashlee Vance
