<h2>What do you do?</h2>
<p>
I improve peoples' lives and happiness via my writing, songs, and musical performances. (Wishful thinking, but that's my mission!)
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
I love to write and create stories and songs, manufacturing artistic creations from my imagination that last forever. I hope they are useful or enjoyable to like minded people (punk rock atheists). I want to advance more free thought, intelligence, atheism, and art.
</p>

<h2>Recent thought or epiphany?</h2>
<p>
As part of working on my sci fi novel for NaNoWriMo, I conceived of a parallel universe where artists and musicians are the most revered people, like royalty, and the consequence of this emphasis on art is great advancement in intelligence and subsequently science/technology (per Einstien's famous quote: "“The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of true art and true science.”)
</p>

<h2>What should we read?</h2>
<p>
This is a tough one, but I have always returned time and again to "The Short and Sweet Guide to Being Fucking Awesome" by Julien Smith (<a href="http://inoveryourhead.net/the-short-and-sweet-guide-to-being-fucking-awesome/).">http://inoveryourhead.net/the-short-and-sweet-guide-to-being-fucking-awesome/).</a>
