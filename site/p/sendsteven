<h1>Steven Irby</h1>

<h2><a href="/">/now</a>: <a href="http://www.sendsteven.com/now/">sendsteven.com/now</a></h2>

<h2>Location:</h2>
<p>
Portland
OR
United States
</p>

<h2>Professional title:</h2>
<p>
Software Engineer / Wantrepreneur
</p>

<h2>What do you do?</h2>
<p>
I travel the world one city at a time, hoping to add value whenever / wherever I can, and hope to inspire others to follow their dreams and passion.
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
I live to travel and see new places. My whole life, my dream was to travel the world. I originally went to college for International Relations, I actually wanted to be a diplomat stationed in another country, learning another language, and representing my country. I ended up becoming a software engineer instead; go figure! I ended up finding a way to travel and work though. Now I'm slowly making my way around the world.
</p>

<h2>Recent thought or epiphany?</h2>
<p>
You don't need a million dollars to travel the world and live very very well. Also, getting someone to click a buy button on a website is hard!
</p>

<h2>What should we read?</h2>
<p>
“The power of habit” - you can't make your dreams come true, without habits moving towards them.  Also <a href="http://markmanson.net/fuck-yes">http://markmanson.net/fuck-yes</a>
