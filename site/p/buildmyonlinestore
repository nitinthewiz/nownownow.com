<h2>Professional title:</h2>
<p>
Founder of a podcast called Build My Online Store, a show that I’ve been hosting and producing since 2012. It was one of the first e-commerce podcast starting out, and we now get around 15,000-20,000 downloads every month. Outside of that I also help other e-commerce stores with their email marketing and blog content. I also run my own store Baller Leather where I sell ultra-slim handmade Italian leather wallets for men.

<h2>What do you do?</h2>

I help e-commerce stores and brands with their online marketing.

<h2>Why?</h2>

It bring me joy to improve someone’s situation, life, or business.
</p>

<h2>Recent thought or epiphany?</h2>
<p>
“Life is a test and you pass if you can be true to yourself. To get the first question correct, all you have to know is who you are. A life is just one letter away from a lie.”
</p>

<h2>What should we read?</h2>
<p>
“The Truth: An Uncomftortable Book About Relationships” by Neil Strauss
