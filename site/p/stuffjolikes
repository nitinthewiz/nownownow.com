<h2>What do you do?</h2>
<p>
I am a great connector and networker with friends and business contacts from all walks of life - I love to help people find tools, other people or ideas that empower them to help themselves.
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
I can't not do it!
</p>

<h2>Recent thought or epiphany?</h2>
<p>
After watching Emilie Wapnick's TED talk “Why some of us don't have one true calling” <<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/emilie_wapnick_why_some_of_us_don_t_have_one_true_calling>">http://www.ted.com/talks/emilie_wapnick_why_some_of_us_don_t_have_one_true_calling></a> I realised it is OK to have loads of different interests and it was actually a huge relief to discover others like me. I may need to focus better on one thing at a time but my diversity is something that makes me who I am.
</p>

<h2>What should we read?</h2>
<p>
Not a book as such.. but I am currently doing the edx course U.Lab: Transforming Business Society and Self based on the ideas of Otto Scharmer and Katrin Kaufer in their book Leading from the Emerging Future: From Ego-System to Eco-System Economics.  A really profound course and a very different way of looking at problems in a time when the world is changing rapidly and existing models are unable to cope with issues such as refugees, climate change, inequality and more <<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/transforming-business-society-self-u-lab-mitx-15-671x>">https://www.edx.org/course/transforming-business-society-self-u-lab-mitx-15-671x></a>
