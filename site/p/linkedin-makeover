<h2>Location:</h2>

Delran

</p>

<h2>Professional title:</h2>
<p>
My company works with executives and professionals from all over the world.  We write LinkedIn profiles but ultimately what we are really doing is helping people tell their story and brand themselves effectively so they can change  how others perceive them as well as change how they perceive themselves.
</p>

<h2>What do you do?</h2>
<p>
I help people realize their value and potential by uncovering their professional story.
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
I truly believe we are changing people's lives... and I love that.
</p>

<h2>Recent thought or epiphany?</h2>
<p>
I am beginning to realize very few people are ever told that they are worthwhile and valuable.  It's important to compliment people-- not just on what they are wearing or how they look but on who they are on the inside.
