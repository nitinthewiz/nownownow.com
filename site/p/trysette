<h2>What do you do?</h2>
<p>
I write songs about my life experiences, usually about the subject of love.
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
I started writing songs as an outlet for my emotions, but once I began receiving feedback from people about how much joy these songs were bringing to their lives and about how much my music was touching their hearts, it became much more than just about me. Now when I write a new song, I think about bringing joy to peoples' lives.
</p>

<h2>Recent thought or epiphany?</h2>
<p>
When you focus on something that you're passionate about, and I mean put 100% into what it is you are trying to achieve, doors open, ideas come, people come into your life to assist you, and miracles happen.
