<h1>Bruce Chenoweth</h1>

<h2><a href="/">/now</a>: <a href="http://abcompany.com/now/">abcompany.com/now</a></h2>

<h2>Location:</h2>
<p>
New Plymouth
ID
United States
</p>

<h2>Professional title:</h2>
<p>
ATM-G  (Advanced Toastmaster, Gold level).  S.I.P.E. (Senior Inhabitant of Planet Earth)
</p>

<h2>What do you do?</h2>
<p>
I learn and share what keeps our bodies healthy - NATURALLY!
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
My life was saved from a disease thought to be terminal because I was fortunate to know someone who knew better. For whatever reasons, an enormous body of life-sustaining knowledge is repressed. By committing to sleuth out and share that knowledge with others, I learn, embed and apply it for myself. As my family and friends see my results, they tend to adopt and apply the knowledge themselves. This keeps them with me longer. It is all quite selfish, actually.
</p>

<h2>Recent thought or epiphany?</h2>
<p>
Gratitude is the Master-Key to every door.  Every moment, every incident, is a great blessing if we choose to recognize it as such.  Worry is the most powerful means of affirming and attaining that which I do not want.
</p>

<h2>What should we read?</h2>
<p>
"Your Health Your Choice" by M. Ted Morter.  "You're Not Sick, You're Thirsty" by F. Batmanghelidj.
