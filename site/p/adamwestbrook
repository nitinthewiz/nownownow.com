<h1>Adam Westbrook</h1>

<h2>Location:</h2>
<p>
Paris

France
</p>

<h2>Professional title:</h2>
<p>
I'm a Video Essayist for delve.tv and Fusion
</p>

<h2>What do you do?</h2>
<p>
My videos try to encourage people (firstly myself, and hopefully others) to take learning more seriously: learning for the sake of it.
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
I'm just really fascinated with understanding and practicing how to tell visual stories using the film form. All my projects are convenient vehicles to force me to practice telling a new story every month or so and to put it in front of an audience.
</p>

<h2>Recent thought or epiphany?</h2>
<p>
The last line of T.S. Elliot's poem East Coker V has been pinned on my wall for the last month: "For us, there is only the trying. The rest is not our business." A perfect reminder that you're entitled to the work but not the outcomes of the work.
</p>

<h2>What should we read?</h2>
<p>
You Are Not a Gadget by Jaron Lanier - "It's not often you read a book that completely changes your mind about something you thought you felt confident about. This isn't the easiest read, but it's a vital challenge to the idea that technology and in particular the Internet is unequivocally awesome. Lanier's ideas have seeped into and influenced my thinking and working. It's an essential read for anyone with a stake in the Internet."
