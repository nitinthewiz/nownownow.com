<h1>Radhika Morabia</h1>

<h2><a href="/">/now</a>: <a href="http://rmorabia.com/now/">rmorabia.com/now</a></h2>

<h2>Location:</h2>
<p>
Los Angeles

United States
</p>

<h2>Professional title:</h2>
<p>
I'm First Mate on a ship called FreelanceToWin <<a href="http://freelancetowin.com/>,">http://freelancetowin.com/>,</a> which empowers individuals to create freelance careers that fit around their lives.
</p>

<h2>What do you do?</h2>
<p>
I want to get everything I want out of life without ever having to do anything I don't want to do, and help other people go after the same lofty goal along the way.
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
I'm tired of people accepting jobs, people, and lives that don't fit into their real goals and desires. People say, "I'll get to it eventually." I want to get to it NOW.
</p>

<h2>Recent thought or epiphany?</h2>
<p>
No one is stopping you from instantly raising your rates by 300%. In other words, it's okay to be an 18-year-old who makes $100+ an hour.
</p>
