<h2><a href="/">/now</a>: <a href="http://thewanderingminimalist.com/now/">thewanderingminimalist.com/now</a></h2>

<h2>Location:</h2>

<h2>Professional title:</h2>
<p>
Cloud Services Engineer @ Acquia, Inc.  Rock climber.

<h2>What do you do?</h2>
<p>
I support systems and people while seeking adventure and challenge.
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
I want to travel and experience more of the world around me.  I’ve spent long periods of time alone in stagnant places and I feel like I could offer a lot more to people and the world at-large if I saw more of it.  I seek adventure and simplicity.
</p>

<h2>Recent thought or epiphany?</h2>
<p>
People will tell you every day, in as many ways as they can manage, that the “ideal life situation” of having work that has a purpose, having “success” (whatever that means), and adventure are all mutually-exclusive.  Those people are not only wrong, they’re terrified.  The people that believe that these things can be inclusive and integrated into a meaningful, wonderful, adventurous life are working to dispel a myth around mediocrity and are re-defining what it means to be successful in an age where pensions, retirement, and sedentary life have lost their meaning.
