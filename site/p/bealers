<h1>Darren Beale</h1>

<h2><a href="/">/now</a>: <a href="http://bealers.com/now/">bealers.com/now</a></h2>

<h2>Location:</h2>
<p>
Shrewsbury
Shropshire
United Kingdom
</p>

<h2>Professional title:</h2>
<p>
Owner / Manager of a software development company called Siftware (Siftware.com).
</p>

<h2>What do you do?</h2>
<p>
I specialise in removing the hassle & worry for owners or managers of existing PHP web applications; helping them keep key, possibly aging, custom web sites running, up-to-date & secure.
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
Frankly: I used to just like geeking out & solving people's problems. These days as I've stepped away from cutting code I enjoy the multiple challenges of running a business and building a great team whilst working with clients who value what we do.
</p>

<h2>Recent thought or epiphany?</h2>
<p>
A lot of people in my industry, particularly those leaning towards the geekier/engineering side, appear to be living relatively unhealthy lives, be that poor diet, lack of exercise, working too hard or having poor sleeping habits. I worry that a lot of my peers are, like I did, storing up a bunch of health problems that may come back and bite them in later life.
</p>

<h2>What should we read?</h2>
<p>
Non-fiction: “Zen To Done (ZTD)” by Leo Babauta.  <a href="http://zenhabits.net/zen-to-done-ztd-the-ultimate-simple-productivity-system">http://zenhabits.net/zen-to-done-ztd-the-ultimate-simple-productivity-system</a> Fiction: “Ready Player One” by Earnest Cline (it might help if you grew up in the 80s)
