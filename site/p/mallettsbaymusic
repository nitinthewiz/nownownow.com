<h2>What do you do?</h2>
<p>
I promote independent singer/songwriters and bands without breaking their banks.

Music is my vocation, avocation, and medicine for my soul. I have a calling.  For many years it was working as a music educator with high school students, and now it is to help promote indies.

Perseverance is key to following your dreams and goals.  Like the old song says, â€œpick yourself up, brush yourself off, start all over again."
