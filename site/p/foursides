<h2>What do you do?</h2>
<p>
Help hotels discover untapped sources of revenue while also helping them engage their guests in a more meaningful manner.
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
Working in the hospitality industry allows me to merge several of my passions into one: helping guests discover new places to stay and activities to do, engaging with guests or owners to discover their personal stories, and also nourish my hunger for all things business related. I love being able to use my curiosity to discover new trends in the hospitality industry and using my love of math to play around in spreadsheets and analyze numbers.
</p>

<h2>Recent thought or epiphany?</h2>
<p>
When we grow beyond the egotistical demands of money and become more generous with it, we give people more than just money or objects. We are giving those people the opportunity to free themselves from the relationship they have developed with money. They stop thinking about how much something cost, and more about what that item means to them.
