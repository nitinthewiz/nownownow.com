<h1>Jon Rhodes</h1>

<h2><a href="/">/now</a>: <a href="http://jonrhodes.me/now/">jonrhodes.me/now</a></h2>

<h2>Location:</h2>
<p>
Sheffield
England
United Kingdom
</p>

<h2>Professional title:</h2>
<p>
Senior Project Manager at Quba (a digital agency based in Sheffield)
</p>

<h2>What do you do?</h2>
<p>
I manage digital and web projects for a range of clients.
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
I've been a project manager since 2007 when my boss at the time mentioned he thought I'd be well suited to this type of job. I've spent the last eight years trying to get better each day at managing projects, working with internal teams, working with clients and working with third parties. It seems to be going pretty well so far.
</p>

<h2>Recent thought or epiphany?</h2>
<p>
Why do I regularly spend extra hours at work, unpaid, to sort out day-to-day tasks rather than make sure I am home every day to either put my daughter to bed or give her breakfast.  I wrote an article about it - <a href="http://jonrhodes.me/work-vs-life-balance/">http://jonrhodes.me/work-vs-life-balance/</a>
</p>

<h2>What should we read?</h2>
<p>
This varies all the time, but at the minute: A book I'd recommend would be 'Microadventures' by Alastair Humphreys.  Microaventures are brilliant, liberating and accessible little adventures that anyone can do.  I'd recommend anyone to try it.
