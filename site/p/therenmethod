<h2>Location:</h2>

<h2>Professional title:</h2>
<p>
The REN Method - Founder / Creative Disruption Strategist. Fig & Honey - Founder / Maker.  My body care line from Fig & Honey is heading into at least two national retail chains in 2016, and The REN Method taking me to London and Scotland.
</p>

<h2>What do you do?</h2>
<p>
Using the artist's perspective, I develop new leaders to fill the gap, working with companies around the globe.
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
I help people unblock creative prohibition and develop their ability to be something greater and more balanced, because it's what I was born to do.  It's the one thing that I do very differently from anyone else.  I have always been a "50/50" with organization/strategy and interruptive thinking, and this is my time to help other people see the merits of operating from both perspectives.
</p>

<h2>Recent thought or epiphany?</h2>
<p>
Two: #1: Tap the well of who you are, not the trickle someone else assigns you. #2: Create and destroy in equal measure.
