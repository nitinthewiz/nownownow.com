<h2>What do you do?</h2>
<p>
I help people sell their homes at the best market value in the best time frame for the market and I help buyers find the homes of their new homes!
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
My passion is helping others.  I speant 30 years in the medical field and coaching women from abuse.  Now, I am still helping others only its a different emotion, its an investment in their life.
</p>

<h2>Recent thought or epiphany?</h2>
<p>
It doesn't matter how much you have in your pocket so long as you are fulfilling one of the basic human needs of contribution.  When you catch a passion for helping others a richer life will come back to you.  I've always had that passion, I'm just helping now in different ways.
