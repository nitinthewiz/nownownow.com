<h2>What do you do?</h2>
<p>
I do Pacific island research, analysis & strategy.
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
For almost 20 years I have taught, mentored, counselled and worked alongside many Pacific island people who are striving to improve their lives and the lives of those around them. My students, clients, friends, colleagues and acquaintances share with me their hopes and fears. They include me in conversations that are taking place locally, nationally and regionally. For these reasons I am committed to contributing to the development of this region in whatever ways I can.
</p>

<h2>Recent thought or epiphany?</h2>
<p>
You can't know what you don't know. When I find myself frustrated at someone's lack of knowledge or understanding about a given context I remind myself that they may not have had the benefit of my experience and try to work our how I can best share it with them.
</p>

<h2>What should we read?</h2>
<p>
Recommended book or article: 'The Mountain' by Drusilla Modjeska - Papua New Guinea is a fascinating and complex country. This book helped me understand it a bit better. I reviewed it here: <a href="http://devpolicy.org/the-mountain-by-drusilla-modjeska-essential-reading-for-png-enthusiasts-20140701/">http://devpolicy.org/the-mountain-by-drusilla-modjeska-essential-reading-for-png-enthusiasts-20140701/</a>
