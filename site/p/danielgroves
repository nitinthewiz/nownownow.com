<h2><a href="/">/now</a>: <a href="https://danielgroves.net/now">danielgroves.net/now</a></h2>

<h2>Location:</h2>
<p>
Plymouth
Devon
United Kingdom
</p>

<h2>Professional title:</h2>
<p>
Junior Software Developer at Vualto.  Freelance Landscape Photographer.
</p>

<h2>What do you do?</h2>
<p>
I write software to pay the bills so that I can go on adventures and inspire others to do the same through photography and storytelling.
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
I love the process of producing things that others can enjoy; weather that is to build life-changing software or to inspire others to leave technology behind and get outside. Photography is a particularly appealing activity because it combines everything I love; being outdoors, inspiring others and producing a final results that other can truly enjoy. In a world where everything is becoming digital it’s nice to be working on something that, at the end of the process, I can actually enjoy as a physical artifact.

<h2>Recent thought or epiphany?</h2>
<p>
A great landscape does not make a great picture, and a great picture does not make a great landscape.
</p>

<h2>What should we read?</h2>
<p>
“Racing Through the Dark: The Fall and Rise of David Millar” by David Millar is a fascinating insight into the true qualities of professional road racing, the pressures that some with it and the internal drug abuse culture. A fascinating read that I can thoroughly recommend.
