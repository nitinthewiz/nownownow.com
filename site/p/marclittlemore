<h1>Marc Littlemore</h1>

<h2><a href="/">/now</a>: <a href="http://www.marclittlemore.com/now">marclittlemore.com/now</a></h2>

<h2>Location:</h2>
<p>
Warrington

United Kingdom
</p>

<h2>Professional title:</h2>
<p>
Principal Software Engineer at the BBC.
</p>

<h2>What do you do?</h2>
<p>
I turn interesting ideas into usable software for work and fun.
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
I have loved computers since the early 80s when I got my first Commodore Vic20 and have been a video game programmer for many years. I like to tinker with technology and have entrepreneurial aspirations. I hope that one or more of my side-projects will eventually become successful businesses.
</p>

<h2>Recent thought or epiphany?</h2>
<p>
In June 2014 I nearly died after contracting streptococcus group A which caused sepsis (blood poisoning). Due to the amazing intensive care staff, I thankfully survived but it’s definitely changed my outlook on life. So in short: Family is everything and life is far too short. Be excellent to each other and don’t sweat the small things.
</p>

<h2>What should we read?</h2>
<p>
I’m guilty of not reading enough but I most recently enjoyed “The Power Of Habit” by Charles Duhigg.
