<h2>Location:</h2>
<p>
Eugene

<h2>Professional title:</h2>
<p>
I work as the Educational Technology Integration and Support Services Manager at the School of Architecture and Allied Arts at the University of Oregon. That’s a fancy way of saying that I manage our Help Desk and consult with faculty on their use of technology for teaching, learning and research. We are school with ten departments that range from Architecture to Digital Arts to Historic Preservation. 
</p>

<h2>What do you do?</h2>
<p>
I attempt to nudge faculty, staff and students into successful uses of technologies to enhance their educational practice. 
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
I have always found myself fascinated with how people learn and how they work. I enjoy seeing individuals and groups grow, change and have success. I started off in the K-12 educational environment and have a strong background in child and human development. This helps me keep perspective in many ways. Learning is not a linear progression, as we all make steps forwards and then take some backwards before going forwards again. Ideally, education should help people have a greater understanding of their world in order to help them live a more fulfilling life, too. 
</p>

<h2>Recent thought or epiphany?</h2>
<p>
We are all fragile and finite and are just trying to figure it out, which is a slightly different version from one of my favorite authors, Sherman Alexie. He said, “We are all fragile, finite and trying to live forever.” 
</p>

<h2>What should we read?</h2>
<p>
There are way too many for me to choose from. However I have always enjoyed, The Razor’s Edge by Somerset Maugham. I’m currently enjoying reading each issue  of the magazine, Off Screen, published by Kai Brach. There are always great interviews and insights there.
